/*
Most INtutive:
The `KthLargest` class uses a **min-heap** (priority queue) to efficiently track the `k`th largest element in a dynamic stream of numbers. 

- **Min-Heap of Size `k`**: The heap is maintained with at most `k` elements, ensuring that the smallest element in the heap is always the `k`th largest element in the stream.
- **Initialization**: When the object is initialized, all elements from the input list are added to the heap. If the heap exceeds size `k`, the smallest element is removed.
- **Adding New Scores**: When a new score is added:
  - If the heap has fewer than `k` elements, the score is added directly.
  - If the heap has `k` elements, the smallest element (root) is replaced only if the new score is larger.
- **Efficiency**: The heap ensures that each insertion and removal of the smallest element happens in `O(log k)` time, making it efficient for large streams.

This approach ensures that after every insertion, the `k`th largest element can be retrieved efficiently from the heapâ€™s root.*/
